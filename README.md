# ATM CARD VERIFICATION

You are probably familiar with the online card payment platforms or gateways,
where you are asked to input your card number for payments throught the gateway,

Then while you are inputing the numbers, right after the first or second digit, the 
system identifies the card type and displays it beside the input box and does a full verification after the input.

## This is a Node Js Console App that;

(i)     Confirms the Atm card type, whether Visa or Master card based on Bank Standard Card Identification Number system.

(ii)    Verifies the Atm card type requirements based on Bank Standard Atm Card Number system.
