# ATM CARD VERIFICATION

You are probably familiar with the online card payment platforms or gateways,
where you are asked to input your card number for payments throught the gateway,

Then while you are inputing the numbers, right after the first or second digit, the 
system identifies the card type and displays it beside the input box and does a full verification after the input.

## This is a Node Js Console App that;

(i)     Confirms the Atm card type, whether Visa or Master card based on Bank Standard Card Identification Number system.

(ii)    Verifies the Atm card type requirements based on Bank Standard Atm Card Number system.

## How To Use

i.      Clone this repo to your local machine, using `git clone {repo-url}`.
ii.     Run the following code for program to accept user input, `npm install prompt-sync`.
iii.    Run the code through the terminal, using `node index.js`.

## Detailed description of the Regular Expression Pattern (RegEx):

So, in the first RegEx pattern, visaCardRegEx = /^4(\d){3}(\s?(\d){4}){3}$/

    The ^4 in the RegEx tells the system that the 4 must be matched first.
    (\d){3} says that 3 digits must be matched after the preceeding digit.
    (\s?(\d){4}) means there could be a whitespace before a group of 4 digits.
    {3}$ means the preceeding group of characters and digits must be matched 3 times before the criteria is completed

Then, in the second RegEx pattern, masterCardRegEx = /^5[1-5](\d){2}(\s?(\d){4}){3}$/

    The ^5 in the RegEx tells the system that the 5 must be matched first, followed by a digit withing the range '1-5'.
    (\d){2} says that 2 digits must be matched after the preceeding digit.
    (\s?(\d){4}) means there could be a whitespace before a group of 4 digits.
    {3}$ means the preceeding group of characters and digits must be matched 3 times before the criteria is completed
